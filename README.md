[0.24] StarSystems v0.1
=======================

This plugin will allow for the creation of multiple colored stars with working light.

### Features:
Modifies the sun into a black hole.

Creates a new Kerbol to house all the original planets.

Allows you to add your own stars.

Handles everything associated with starlight.

Solar panels work.

Allows usage with existing save games**

### To Do:
More testing.

Make a better ship fixer for KSP version 0.24.

Make PF:CE planets for Corbo and Dolas.

Make more colors for stars.

Make a new shader for the black hole.


Optional: make a dust disk for the black hole.

Optional: have this plugin create planets as well.

### Adding your own stars:
You can add your own stars by copying one of the existing "Star" nodes in the config file and changing it parameters (make sure you have a unique name and FlightGlobalIndex). Since star colors is quite a delicate balance of parameters any color you fill in as color value that is not "Blue" or "Red" will be interpreted as normal yellow.


DISCLAIMER:
===========
BACKUP YOUR SAVE FILE! Due to the nature of this plugin it is possible to lose existing ships between loading a save game and starting a flight. There is a fix in place that should prevent most ship disappearances, but I advise you backup your save games before installing this nonetheless. If you notice a ship disappearing in the tracking station just go back to the space center and it should reload.

**importing large save files will result in some ship loss regardless of the fix that is in place.
